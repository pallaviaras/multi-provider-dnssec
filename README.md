# multi-provider-dnssec
IETF draft to describe multi provider DNSSEC models

distribute their authoritative DNS service. Two providers is fairly
typical and this allows the DNS service to survive a complete failure
of any single provider. This document outlines some possible models of
DNSSEC deployment in such an environment.
